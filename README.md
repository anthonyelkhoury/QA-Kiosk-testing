# QA Case Study ‚Äì Kiosk Ordering Software

## Project Overview
This repository contains a QA and testing case study for a **Kiosk Ordering Software** developed for a restaurant environment.  
The goal of this project was to ensure that the system‚Äôs **frontend functionalities, usability, and reliability** met the required standards through **manual testing and structured test cases**.

---

## Objectives
- Validate core features of the kiosk ordering flow (navigation, cart, payment).  
- Identify usability and security issues (e.g., HTTPS, input validation).  
- Provide actionable recommendations to improve the customer experience.  
- Document all test cases, results, and severity levels.

## Tools & Techniques
- **Manual Testing**  
- **Browser Developer Tools (Console inspection)**  
- **Excel** ‚Äì Test case management  
- **Word (PDF Report)** ‚Äì QA documentation

## Repository Contents
- `Kiosk.pdf` ‚Üí Full QA report with test cases, screenshots, and results.  
- `Kiosk.xlsx` ‚Üí Structured test case sheet with expected/actual results.  

---

## Key Findings
- **Website Security:** Application used HTTP instead of HTTPS ‚Üí major security risk.  
- **Translation Issues:** Inconsistent language switching (English ‚Üî French).  
- **Cart Functionality:** Glitches with item duplication and incorrect totals.  
- **Input Validation:** Weak validation on phone numbers and forms.  
- **Design & Responsiveness:** Overlapping UI elements and poor responsiveness on different screen sizes.
